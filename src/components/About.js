                <p>Throughout time, people have used the sum of their blended experiences to forge something new through whatever medium they choose. Driven by a fear of the unknown future, many create to define that unknown for themselves with their own works.
                <br></br>In that same spirit, this website exists as the home for creations crafted by Sam Rojas. 
                <br></br>He resides mostly in Boston, MA, but lives and works from anywhere.</p>
